## Election audit Summary:
This script can be used for any future election because it gives us a great breakdown of counties or even states if the data was different. By changing the list of counties and candidates you can use the same layout to find results needed. The added insight can be a guide for future election performance, so that you may properly allocate resources where turnout is low or demographics are hard to reach. For example:

1. The election results file contains 3 columns. If you wanted to add a fourth column for "Political Party", we could adjust our code to display the following:
   -  votes per political party
   -  vote percentage for political party out of total votes

If this were a federal election, we could create dictionary similar to "county_list" that contains the name of the political party as the KEY, and the votes per political party as the VALUE. 
        
2. If you wanted to understand the age of the voters, we could add a column for "Age" that corresponds with each Ballot ID. This would allow you to understand the following:
   - Which age group had the most voters?
   - What age group was most responsible for the winner of the election? (Which age group did the support come from?)
